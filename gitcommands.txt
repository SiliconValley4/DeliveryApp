git branch -a : shows all branches
git remote : shows all remotes from this repo
git remote -v : verbose
git branch -d name : delete branch
git branch -D name : DELETE branch
git checkout branchname: switch from current branch to  "branchname"
git checkout -b some : switch to NEW branch "some"
git remote remove "origin" - remove origin
git remote add "name" "LINK": add new origin

adding a remote origin means to give the long link an alias, that is a remote

How to work within a group:

- git clone link
- Because we clone the repository from an exisiting one on github, there's already an alias "remote" called "whatever it was named, probably origin"


rm -f -r folder : remove forcefully folder "name"
