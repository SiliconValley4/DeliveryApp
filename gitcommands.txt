git branch -a : shows all branches
git remote : shows all remotes from this repo
git remote -v : verbose
git branch -d name : delete branch
git branch -D name : DELETE branch
git checkout branchname: switch from current branch to  "branchname"
git checkout -b some : switch to NEW branch "some"
git remote remove "origin" - remove origin
git remote add "name" "LINK": add new origin labeled "name" to the link "LINK"

adding a remote origin means to give the long link an alias

a remote is just an alias

How to work within a group:
---------------------------

- git clone link
- Because we clone the repository from an exisiting one on github, there's already an alias "remote" called "whatever it was named, probably origin"

OpenSource:
-----------
How to individually work from an existing repo: 
----------------------------------------------
- Fork public repo from github
on git bash:
- git clone "repolink"
- add commit changes
- git push "remote" "branch" - 
after having cloned the repo post fork, you have to specify the name of the remote and the current branch you want to push to the repo
rm -f -r folder : remove forcefully folder "name"

To contribute some change from a forked/clone repo:
---------------------------------------------------
On github -> "New Pull Request"
-> Create Pull Rerquest
-> Accept from Original Repo Creator
