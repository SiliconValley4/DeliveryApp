Git Commands!!
------------

git config --list

git branch -a : shows all branches
git branch "name" : create branch labeled "name"
git branch -d name : delete branch
git branch -D name : DELETE branch

git checkout branchname: switch from current branch to  "branchname" if it exists
git checkout -b some : switch to NEW branch "some"

git remote : shows all remotes from this repo
git remote -v : verbose
git remote remove "origin" - remove origin
git remote add "name" "LINK" : add new origin labeled "name" to the link "LINK"
git remote show "name" : shows information about remote labeled "name"
git remote set-url --push origin no_push : remove push setting for particular remote

git remote set-head "remotename" "branchname" : sets the branch name of the remote to be the head.

git branch -u "remote"/"branch" : sets upstream branch??

git push --set-upstream "remote" "branch" : allows to simply use "git push" command and use those settings

adding a remote origin means to give the long link an alias

a remote is just an alias

How to work within a group:
---------------------------

- git clone link
- Because we clone the repository from an exisiting one on github, there's already an alias "remote" called "whatever it was named, probably origin"

OpenSource:

How to individually work from an existing repo: 
----------------------------------------------
- Fork public repo from github
on git bash:
- git clone "repolink"
- add commit changes
- git push "remote" "branch" - 
after having cloned the repo post fork, you have to specify the name of the remote and the current branch you want to push to the repo
rm -f -r folder : remove forcefully folder "name"

To contribute some change from a forked/clone repo:
---------------------------------------------------
On github -> "New Pull Request"
-> Create Pull Rerquest
-> Accept from Original Repo Creator


To Host Website on GitHub Pages:
--------------------------------
change the name of the default branch to "gh-pages"
